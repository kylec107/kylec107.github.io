								<h2>Evade Game</h2>
								<!-- First draft -->
								<!-- <h3>Programming Languages / Software: Java</h3>
								<p>I created this game by drawing from interpretations of the snake game and putting my take on them. In this game the player controls their avatar (a white square) 
									using the WASD keys and is shown the health bar, score, and level in real-time. The goal of the game is to survive multiple waves of enemies varying in speed and 
									intelligence by dodging the enemy avatars and eating apples to regenerate health. This game uses Object Oriented Programming to spawn enemies of various types at 
									certain levels (i.e. Basic enemies, Fast enemies who move faster, and Smart enemies who follow the player at a slow pace). Click the button below to download a playable 
									version of the game (may require Java JDK to run).</p> -->

								<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
								<!-- First draft -->
								<!-- <h3>Programming Languages / Software: Java, Android Studios, Figma</h3>
								<p>I developed a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game which first asks for the name of the player designated to X's and then the name of the player designated to O's. The game starts 
									with the turn of player X when both player name's have been entered and the 'Start / Restart' button is pressed. The game grid shown in the user interface uses (x, y) 
									coordinates where column 1 starts from the left moving to column 3 on the right, and row 1 starts at the top moving down to row 3 on the bottom. The player with the 
									current turn is displayed in the user interface and they must input a column number and a row number before pressing the 'Confirm Move' button to make their move. 
									After pressing the button the designated symbol for the player will fill the coordinate position chosen and the next player will take their turn and so on until a winner 
									is declared or the game ends as a tie. The backend of the game accounts for scenarios where a player chooses a taken position and tracks filled positions to declare a 
									winner as soon as a winning pattern is made. The backend of the game is fully developed and can function with console output. The game can be used for application 
									implementation through Android Studios. Click the button below to view the mock-up Graphical User Interface.</p> -->

								<h2>Banking App</h2>
								<!-- First draft -->
								<!-- <h3>Programming Languages / Software: Java </h3>
								<p>I developed the backend for a Bank app system that asks for a clients name and initial balance upon adding them as a client in the bank. Afterwards the client can use the app to perform 
									withdrawls, deposits, or transfers to another existing client in the bank. I used Object Oriented Programming principles to handle the bank and clients as objects with varying 
									attributes. This app updates the status of a client after every transaction and outputs an error sequence if there is a problem in execution (i.e. transfer of funds to a client 
									not in the bank system). This program taught me valuable lessons about the inner workings of Object Oriented Programming and programs we use in our everyday lives</p> -->
